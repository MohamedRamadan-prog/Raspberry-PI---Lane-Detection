# Raspberry-PI---Lane-Detection
implement the hardware in this module, we need to change some parameters and thresholds in the code according to the video that will be taken, then run the code on raspberry pi. - Since camera calibration, perspective transform and lane curvature are not implemented in the simple lane, so the frame rate is high which is obviously shown in real-time computing.
